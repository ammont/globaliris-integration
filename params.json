// the return array will also include the schedule result\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is how you would implement a payment with Adress Verification (AVS):\r\n\r\n\t$payment = new RemotePayment;\r\n\r\n\t$payment->setInfo($merchant, $order_id, $amount, $secret, $account);\r\n\r\n\t$payment->setCartInfo($card_num, $card_exp, $card_name, $card_type, $maestro_issue, $ccv2, $presind);\r\n\r\n\t$payment->setAddressInfo($country, $street_num, $postal_code);\r\n\r\n\t$payment->authorize(); // the return array will also include the AVS check result\r\n\r\n\r\nImplementing the remote payment gateway with 3D Secure support needs a little more work, here is how you would do it:\r\n\r\nfor 3D secure we have a redirect to the issuing bank for checking the password, so we need to have 2 steps, a step for code that redirects the user to the bank and another step for returning the user from the bank and completing the payment, there is a functional sample payment gateway implemented in process.php and return.php files which you can take a look at. first lets take a look at the first step:\r\n\r\n\t$payment = new RemotePayment;\r\n\r\n\t$payment->setInfo($merchant, $order_id, $amount, $secret, $account);\r\n\r\n\t$payment->setCartInfo($card_num, $card_exp, $card_name, $card_type, $maestro_issue, $ccv2, $presind);\r\n\r\n\t$res = $payment->send3dSecure($term_url)// $term_url is the return url which you specify.\r\n\r\n\tif (is_array($res))\r\n\t{\r\n\t\t// there was an error which the payment so RemotePayment::send3dSecure() method has returned the result array\r\n\t}\r\n\telse\r\n\t{\r\n\t\t// the  first step has been successful so RemotePayment::send3dSecure() will return the redirect form which you will need to echo\r\n\r\n\t\techo $res;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nok this will send the user to the bank, then the user enters his/her password and bank will return the user to the url specified by you with $term_url, when returning, The GlobalIris system will send you some parameters in $_POST which you will need to pass to RemotePayment::recieve3dSecure() method, now lets take a look at the return step:\r\n\r\n\t$payment = new RemotePayment;\r\n\r\n\t$payment->setInfo($merchant, $order_id, $amount, $secret, $account);\r\n\r\n\t$payment->setCartInfo($card_num, $card_exp, $card_name, $card_type, $maestro_issue, $ccv2, $presind);\r\n\r\n\t$res = $payment->recieve3dSecure($_POST['PaRes'], $_POST['MD'], $merchant, $secret, $account);\r\n\r\n\tif($res['status'] === 'success')\r\n\t{\r\n\t\techo \"Thanks for your payment, your payment was successful<br>\";\r\n\t}\r\n\telse\r\n\t{\r\n\t\techo \"There was an error with your payment<br>\";\r\n\t\techo $res['message'].'<br>';\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n$res will be an array with the payment result info same as what RemotePayment::authorize() method returns, you can check $res['status'] to determine if the payment have been successful or not.\r\n\r\nplease note that you can set schedule or AVS check for 3d Secure payments too.\r\n\r\nat last you can find a list of parameters used, along with their description:\r\n\r\n1. $merchant: your GlobalIris merchant id\r\n1. $order_id: the order id to track your order, the payment will be submitted with this order id in the GlobalIris Back Office.\r\n1. $amount: the payment amount\r\n1. $secret: your GlobalIris secret key.\r\n1. $account: your GlobalIris account.\r\n1. $card_num: the payer's card number.\r\n1. $card_exp: the payer's card expiration date.\r\n1. $card_type: the payer's card type, supported values: VISA, MC, MAESTRO, AMEX\r\n1. $card_name: the cardholder's name\r\n1. $maestro_issue: issue number for MAESTRO card type, specify it only for MAESTRO cards\r\n1. $ccv2: the CVN of the card, if you wan CVN check (CCV2 for VISA cards).\r\n1. $presind: indicates if you want CVN check or not, 1 is for forcing CVN check.\r\n1. $term_url: the url to return the user from 3D secure to.\r\n\r\nFor Schedule:\r\n\r\n1. $alias: the alias for schedule, this will be saved with the scheduled payment, enter what better describes the payment.\r\n1. $frequency: the schedule frequency, you can use any frequency supported by GlobalIris, you can find the list at the documentation below, example: 'monthly'\r\nhttps://resourcecentre.globaliris.com/products.html?doc_id=118&id=177\r\n1. $repeats: number of times you want the payment to be taken.\r\n\r\n### Important Notice:\r\nI have no guaranty that this class would function properly, it might have bugs and mistakes, so you have to use it with your own responsibility and I will not accept any responsibility for any problemØŒ difficulty or damage that using my tool (this class) would cause.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-43176760-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
